\section{Overview}
We are aim to build up a systemt that perform testcase which \\
specify by a script.

And there is some problems need to be solved:

\begin{itemize}
\item What is your script look like ?
\item What scenes ?
\item Archtecture of the system.
\end{itemize}

\section{Language Definition}
Name that language as DA. \\

First, let's look at what we want to describe by DA. Testcase, a script about \\
how to do a test, is the thing that we want to describe by DA. Testcase use collection
of executors to communicate with DUT and then give assertion about result by status
of executors, DUT.

so DA should be able to describe how executors and DUT do action and query status from
them.

We are able to do thoses things by python, python has many libs with these libs
we are able to perform computation on python side easily. But python's performance
is a problem, some test may require low latency.

A solution is to compile python script into another form so that it able to
executed by a well-performance system.
